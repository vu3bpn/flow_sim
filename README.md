# Flow Simulation

This repository contains tools and scripts for simulating fluid flow using Python and Go. The project leverages the strengths of both languages to provide efficient and scalable solutions for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problems.

## Features

- **Python**:
  - High-level scripting for setting up simulations.
  - Data visualization and post-processing using libraries like Matplotlib and NumPy.
  - Integration with scientific computing tools for numerical analysis.

- **Go**:
  - High-performance computation for solving flow equations.
  - Parallel processing capabilities for handling large-scale simulations.
  - Lightweight and efficient implementation of core algorithms.

## Use Cases

- Simulating fluid flow in pipes, channels, and open domains.
- Analyzing flow dynamics for engineering and research applications.
- Visualizing velocity fields, pressure distributions, and other flow properties.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flow_sim.git
   cd flow_sim
